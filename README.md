# RawData_To_JSON_Converter

This Spring Boot project, developed in Java with Thymeleaf, features a dynamic form that captures various content. Upon
form submission, the entered data is converted to JSON format. The project utilizes a method to save this JSON data to a
text file named "data.txt" in the project directory. The implementation leverages the Files API for efficient file
handling and provides feedback upon successful saving.
